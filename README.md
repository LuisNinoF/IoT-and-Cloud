# IoT-and-Cloud

## Objective
Demonstrate multiple cases for Cloud connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT) applications:

P1)  WIFI bare metal app to transmit multi-sensor data to the cloud (ThingSpeak), for trend visualization and redundancy analysis.

### Skills Learned

- WIFI implementation
- HTTP Get requests

### Tools Used

- STM32CubeIDE
- ThingSpeak

### Languages

- C

### Hardware

- STM32F4
- ESP8266

### Data Visualization
- This example demonstrates sensor redundancy by comparing two sensor readings that should have the same value. If they differ significantly from each other, an alert can be triggered.
